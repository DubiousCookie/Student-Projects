eggs = 38 #Rules for naming variables:
            #1. Must start with a letter (eventually we'll use underscores);
            #2.  After the first letter, we can use any combination of letters, numbers, underscores;
            #3.  You cannot use words already in use by Python;
            #4.  Make sure your variables make contextual sense (real life);
